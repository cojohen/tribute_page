            This is the greatest and best song in the world...
            Tribute.
            Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
            We was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road.
            All of a sudden,
            There shined a shiny demon,
            In the middle of the road,
            And he said!
            Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls...
            Well me and Kyle,
            We looked at each other,
            And we each said,
            Okay.
            And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
            Just so happened to be
            The best song in the world,
            It was the best song in the world.
            Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
            One and one makes two, two and one makes three,
            It was destiny.
            Once every hundred thousand years or so
            When the sun doth shine
            And the moon doth glow and the grass doth grow.
